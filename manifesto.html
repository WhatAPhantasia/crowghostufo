                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">well, i don't HAVE to explain myself. but i am choosing to do so (at least partially) because i love them that much ^_^<br>
                this is pretty rambley and not all that easy to read, the links below are for skipping around the headers :D</p>

                <div class="col-10 p-2 mb-2 mx-auto border border-2 border-dark border-opacity-25 rounded">
                    <p class="text-center mb-0">
                        <a href="#origins">origins</a> -

                <div style="overflow: hidden;">
                <div class="mb-2">
                    <h2 id="origins" style="font-size: 28px; line-height: 1; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-weight: bold;">
                        origins + why i like them as characters :3</h2>
                    </div>

                <div class="mx-2 mb-2 px-4 float-end"><img src="img/firstelyconcepts.png" class="mx-auto rounded" style="max-width: 200px; width: 100%;" alt="a first concept of ely. they have flatter hair, longer sleeves, and a black feather in their hair."></div>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">it feels best to go in chronological order here. ely was originally like, a half self-insert. their name starts with an e because MY name starts with an e. they very quickly abandoned this role and design, so don't ever draw them like this, thanks! i look nothing like them at all, they are a son to me. they were supposed to be more calm and reserved back then, more focused on the stars and woods. this is actually still their personality in fallen star, the prequel to shooting star, until they develop into the more outgoing ely now :D</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">i very quickly made them friends with dib. he was always my favorite, i'm really fond of characters who deal with and seek out the paranormal (because IM OBSESSED WITH THE PARANORMAL TOO!! founder of my hs paranormal club what up!!) i'm honestly not even sure WHY i'm so attached to him out of EVERY CHARACTER EVER... it's his autism. his rambles. his search for approval. his hatred for zim. you'd probably get the gist of it through this site. actually, i have a drawing EXPLAINING this in the gallery <a href="">here</a> :0! ANYWAY have you seen the shit he goes through in the show? i'm all for hurting my blorbos, but he DESPERATELY needs friends. so i made him one ^_^</p>
                </div>

                <div style="overflow: hidden;">
                <div class="me-2 mb-2 px-4 float-start"><img src="img/gallery/2019-11-07.jpg" class="mx-auto rounded" style="max-width: 300px; width: 100%;" alt="old art of dib and ely hanging out. they stargaze on a roof, investigate with a flashlight and tome, get caught taking pictures of zims base, and dance at prom."></div>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;"><b>eadr was the original ship, and the first iteration of their relationship</b> is this, as quoted from my 2019 notes:</p>
                <p>" And what's with that green kid (that's probably an alien! finally!!) and that big-headed kid who seems to be smarter than everyone else? You can see where I'm going with this. They also definitely have tabs on the Swollen Eyeball Network. One of my story ideas was that they were in the network and contacted Agent Mothman in desperation/curiosity about aliens. They become one of the agents that Mothman has a positive relationship with. Later, they move over to their aunt's and Dib immediately accuses them of being an alien by the logic that every new kid turns out to be an alien. Dib, stop being so paranoid. Chaos ensues!"</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">the whole concept was the "double <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity" target="_blank">mistaken identity</a>" trope: dib doesn't know ely is crows bane, ely doesn't know dib is mothman, etc. i dropped this pretty early on but it's kinda cute still.</p>

                <div style="overflow: hidden;">
                <div class="mx-2 mb-2 px-4 float-end"><img src="img/benchdumbasses.jpg" class="mx-auto rounded" style="max-width: 250px; width: 100%;" alt="dib, ely, and zim sitting on a bench. zim is hugging ely, and dib is absolutely horrified."></div>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">so like, <b>where does zim come in?</b> ok well. you have to understand that as a kid i've always loved love webs. so yes he was the standard love rival, it's OVERDONE i KNOW XD thats why it's fun! i very much initially made zim try to win over ely because of the Drama, but i found that i actually really liked the sides zim and ely (and also dib) brought out in each other. i now SUPER love zim as a character cuz that alien can fit so much EVIL and TERRIBLE COPING MECHANISMS in himself!!! and also he's FUN TO WRITE and i want to PUNT HIM ACROSS A PARKING LOT!!!!!!!</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">they're like a spot of shared loneliness in a world that's really dumb and stupid to them. frustratingly, they see each other as their only equals right now. so you can see that the three of them are selfish people in different ways! this is a small part of why i find them so interesting, and this is a ship that, in the main universe, works to develop this selfishness out of them. ik that sounds a little ignorant, theres nuance here, but HEY this isn't even the main thing that's interesting about them to me!</p>

                        so how'd they meet??</h2>
                    </div>

                <div class="mx-2 mb-2 px-4 float-end"><img src="img/gallery/2022-08-14.png" class="mx-auto rounded" style="max-width: 250px; width: 100%;" alt="dib stands shocked, holding a camcorder up to the viewer. he is in a wooded area, having sprung up from the underbrush."></div>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">ely moves into the city (following <i>many complicated circumstances</i>) and meets a big headed boy in the woods. he rambles and accuses them of being fae, ely saves him from a crow, they investigate a weird cult pit, and somehow become friends over lemon demon.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">it's just as dumb and way more cute than it sounds. ely is instantly fascinated, because this is the first human who's ever been this <i>interesting,</i> let alone wants to hang out with them again. dib is very unsure if this friend is gonna be any different from tak or dwicky... but after everything ely said about <i>admiring his conviction,</i> he finds that he wants to believe that they mean it.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="overflow: hidden;">
                <div class="me-2 mb-2 px-4 float-start"><img src="img/gallery/2021-10-08.png" class="mx-auto rounded" style="max-width: 350px; width: 100%;" alt="zim and gir cornered by two bullies in the city, ely standing up to them and catching their attention."></div>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">later, on ely's first day of 8th grade, they find a weird green kid and dog being bothered by these dumb bullies way older than the both of them. naturally (annoyed how they were picking on his skin,) ely helped him out of the situation. zim's not impressed, but GIR on the other hand ABSOLUTELY LOVES ELY. "the pretty spotty human gave us a FUN BIKE RIDE and AWESOME HEADPATS!!"</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">they find out that they both go to the same school, and zim quickly brushes ely off. as he turns around ely immediately lets it slip that they're SHOCKED that zim's an irken. "IRKEN? HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M IRKEN??" gir's fondness of ely saves them from getting killed on the spot, but they ARE roped into being zim's servant under the justification of "i can't let you go now that you know about the great irken armada... and if you want to help me so bad, you might as well WORK FOR ME!" (gir gave him this idea he's too dumb to use his resources like this)</p>
                </div>

                <div style="overflow: hidden;">
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">anyways, this is great because once ely arrives in homeroom this happens.</p>

                <div class="mx-2 mb-3 px-4"><img src="img/e_ss_alien_THATmoment.png" class="mx-auto rounded" style="width: 100%;" alt="
                    Of course Dib would know ZIM, I internally sighed as I turned to look at him on the opposite side of the room. ZIM's an alien, and I know Dib's not the kind of person to stay away from something like that.
                    “...Wait,” I muttered out loud, pointing at them both. “You two know each other?”
                    I could feel both of their eyes on me in equal disbelief.
                    "></div>

                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">LIKE...... PLEASE.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">in this chapter, ely is currently caught up with helping zim's dumb plan of spiking the skool lunches with truth serum, something that dib is horrified by. "since when were you helping the enemy?!" and ely, not wanting to lose a friend or the earth, assures dib that they're <i>really</i> sticking along so that they don't die, and ALSO to serve as a double agent: they'll thwart zim's plans while making it seem like they're a valuable asset to him. this convinces dib, somehow.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 2em;">the chapter ends with ely convincing zim he doesn't need the opinions and plans of <i>humans,</i> he's IRKEN. he has bigger plans to fry! this DOES end up having bad results in the future, but for NOW it's solidified ely as a good resource for zim, and has given dib hope in more leeway against zim. ely is absolutely LOVING the drama they've been given exclusive viewership to. pretty busy first day, huh.</p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">at a glance, it looks like ely only serves as a mediator between zim and dib, right? this is a severe misunderstanding. ely is only here to have fun, and have only <i>accidentally</i> made them both into better people.</p>
